This branch was made for the sole purpose of getting more detailed execution stats for the brute force algorithm. This, however, requires making various changes to the core functions of the program.
Therefore, this branch should not be pulled into main, as it is only a means to an end, and makes the code much less readable. 

When doing demos, remember to:
1. Use windows xD
2. In CLion: Activate the option to run in external terminal
